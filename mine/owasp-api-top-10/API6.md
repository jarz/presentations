## Mass Assignment

> Binding client provided data (e.g., JSON) to data models, without proper properties filtering based on a whitelist, usually lead to Mass Assignment. Either guessing objects properties, exploring other API endpoints, reading the documentation, or providing additional object properties in request payloads, allows attackers to modify object properties they are not supposed to.

-----

## In other words...

- Attackers use developer conveniences against us
  - Observe data returned in `GET` requests
  - Identify sensitive data that shouldn't be modified by regular users
- Types of properties include
  - Permissions (`isAdmin`)
  - Biz logic (`accountBalance`)
  - Internal (`createdBy`)
- `PUT` and `PATCH` most vulnerable
  - `POST` can still be abused

-----

## Implications

- Bypass security
- Privilege escalation
- Data tampering

## Prevention

- Don't automatically bind request body to entities
- Create _allow lists_ of client modifiable properties
- Build & use schemas for input validation
